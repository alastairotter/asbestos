        Twenty-nine asbestos schools have been identified for replacement to meet school infrastructure norms and standards. But hundreds more schools are falling through cracks in the regulations

      <p>The old blue buildings at Everest Primary School in Newclare will soon be gone, they’re being demolished – carefully – because they contain asbestos, a material that was banned in South Africa in 2008 because it’s known to cause cancer.

      <p>Everest Primary is one of 29 schools in Gauteng earmarked for replacement by the province’s department of education because they are made of asbestos. </p>
<span id="map1"></span>
<p>They all should have been replaced by 29 November 2016, but none of them were. Everest is the only one where construction has even started. </p>

        <p>The deadline was set in November 2013 when Minister of Education Angie Motshekga signed <a href="http://www.gov.za/sites/www.gov.za/files/37081_rg10067_gon920.pdf" target="_new">regulations</a> stipulating the minimum infrastructure norms and standards that all South Africa’s public schools must meet. </p>

<p>The regulations stated that schools made of mud, wood, metal and asbestos had to be replaced with appropriate building materials within three years. No mud, wood or metal schools have been identified in Gauteng, just the asbestos schools. </p>

<p>Everest Primary is not the only asbestos school in the suburb. Newclare Primary School, a couple of blocks away, is on the Gauteng Department of Education’s (GDE’s) replacement list too. But Newclare Primary is unlikely to be replaced until at least 2019. The GDE is way behind schedule.</p>

<p>Newclare lies just west of Joburg’s CBD. More than half of the people who live there are coloured, according to Statistics South Africa’s Census 2011. It’s close to Sophiatown – or Triomf as it used to be known, after the apartheid government in the 1950s forcibly removed the people who lived there. It’s also next door to Westbury, an area with a reputation for drugs and gang violence. </p>

<p>Not far away, on the other side of Main Reef Road, is Riverlea, where another three asbestos schools are located: Wilhelmina Hoskins Primary, Riverlea Primary and Riverlea Secondary School.</p>

<p>In fact, nearly two-thirds of the asbestos schools identified for replacement by the GDE are clustered in south-western Johannesburg, in an area that extends for roughly 15km from Newclare and Riverlea, down through Noordegsig, Orlando East and Pimville in Soweto, to Eldorado Park.</p> 

<p>Six asbestos schools are scattered around Tshwane, one is in Ekurhuleni, two are in Randfontein, one is in Vereeniging, and two are in northern Johannesburg.</p>

        <p>Altogether, more than 25,000 learners and nearly 700 teachers attend these 29 schools.</p>




  <p class="crosshead">
    Entirely versus partially

  </p>
        <p>But the 29 schools on the GDE’s replacement list are only a small part of the province’s asbestos problem.</p>
        <p>For some reason, the school infrastructure regulations distinguish between schools that are built “entirely of asbestos” and those that are built “partially of asbestos”. </p>

<p>Deciding which schools are entirely asbestos clearly isn’t a straightforward process. The GDE’s list has changed three times in the two years since it was first made public. The current list of 29 appears to have been settled on only towards the end of 2016.</p>

      <p>Six asbestos schools are scattered around Tshwane metro, one is in Ekurhuleni metro, two are in Randfontein, one is in Vereeniging, and the rest are in northern Johannesburg.

      </p>



      <p>Not one asbestos school in Gauteng had been replaced by the November deadline. </p>



      <p>By April 2017, four months after the deadline, Everest Primary was the only school that had reached the constuction phase.</p>



      <p>The school infrastructure regulations, for some reason, distinguish between “entirely asbestos” schools and “partially asbestos” schools. Partially asbestos schools have some classrooms or buildings that contain asbestos and some that don’t. So, for example, as school such as Noordgesig Secondary School in Soweto that has 24 asbestos classrooms, but one brick-and-mortar building, does not qualify as an entirely asbestos school, said Khumi Ramulifho, the Democratic Alliance’s “shadow MEC for education” in Gauteng.

    </div>


      <p>The important distinction in terms of the regulations is that by law “entirely asbestos” schools had to be replaced within three years of the regulations being passed, but there is no deadline for the replacement of partially asbestos schools.</p>



      <p>According to a list drawn up by the GDE in 2014, there are 214 partially asbestos schools in Gauteng. The number of asbestos buildings each of these schools have ranges from one to 16, and altogether they total over 1,000. </p>



      <p>What this means is that 243 of the public schools in Gauteng, of which there are about 2,000, contain asbestos, not just 29 – that’s about one in every 10 schools in the province. </p>



      <p>Most of the 214 partially asbestos schools are clustered in townships, such as Soweto, Tembisa, Thokoza, Kathlehong, Vosloorus, Mamelodi and Hammanskraal (see map). </p>



      <p>The school infrastructure regulations gave an extremely short time frame, three years, for the replacement of South Africa’s entirely asbestos schools, which implies a sense of urgency. But neither the Gauteng Education Department (GDE) nor the national Department of Basic Education (DBE) appear to be overtly concerned about the deadline being missed.</p>



      <p>The DBE’s spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, did not respond when asked twice via email whether the minister intends to do anything about the GDE missing the deadline to remove the province’s asbestos schools and whether they are safe for teaching purposes.</p>



      <p>Mahlanga did say he had referred the questions to the appropriate person at the GDE, but the GDE did not reply either. </p>



      <p>Equal Education, a non-governmental organisation that has campaigned for years for legally binding minimum norms and standards for school infrastructure, is far more succinct in its concerns about asbestos. </p>



      <p>“Asbestos fibres are so dangerous that it is illegal for an employer to put any person at risk of exposure to them – and yet teachers and children are in school buildings made of the substance,” said a spokespserson.</p>



      <p>There are over 300,000 learners, two thirds of them primary school children, and nearly 10,000 teachers, not to mention non-teaching staff, at the schools that have been identified by the GDE, according to the DBE’s 2016 school masterlist.</p>



      <p>But it is not clear whether the GDE’s asbestos schools lists are accurate or complete. </p>
      <span id="schools-table"></span>



      <p>One obvious omission is Noordgesig Secondary School in Soweto, which features in the <a href="http://eelawcentre.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/EE-Norms-and-Standards-Affidavit-1.pdf">founding affidavit</a> filed by Equal Education in a case it is bringing against the minister of education and the provincial MECs for education to “fix” the norms and standards regulations. </p>



      <p>“The asbestos classrooms have been in existence for around 70 years, since the school opened. Some of the asbestos classrooms have started to crumble and break, exposing the asbestos,” said Isaac Ramrock, the chairperson of the school governing body in the affidavit.</p>



      <p>If the law is allowed to stand as it is, Noordgesig will have no claim on government as far as the first norms deadline is concerned, hence the #FixTheNorms court case, said a spokesperson for Equal Education. </p>



      <p>No budget has been allocated to replace asbestos classrooms until after 2030, according to the GDE project list dated June 2015 – the only project list the province has been made publicly available. This means that Noordgesig Secondary’s teachers and learners may have to wait 13 years for their dilapidated asbestos classrooms to be replaced.</p>

      

      <p>“There is no rational basis for excluding an unsafe school or classroom from the ambit of the regulation, merely because part of the school is safe,” said Equal Education.</p>
