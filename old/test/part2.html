      Part 2: How safe are asbestos schools?</p><p>The National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) is in a stately solid old colonial building on Hospital Street, Hillbrow, just below the Old Fort Prison and the Constitutional Court. It used to be a medical school, I’m told, back in the days when the area was home to Johannesburg’s first general hospital, before the dense high-rises of Hillbrow started to encroach on the colonial buildings.</p><p>The institute has a long history with asbestos. Its passages are lined with posters that tell the story of the mineral in South Africa. Asbestos mining began in 1883 in the Northern Cape and by the 1970s the country was the world’s third-largest producer of the mineral after Canada and the former USSR. </p><p>Three of the six main types of asbestos were mined here – chrysotile, amosite and crocidolite. About 97% of the world’s crocidolite and nearly all the amosite came from South Africa – the name amosite is an acronym for Asbestos Mines of South Africa. </p><p>The mines started to close in the 1990s, and the last one shut its doors in 2002, but they’ve left a toxic legacy, particularly in the Northern Cape.</p><p>At the back of the building is a laboratory where scientists test material samples for the presence of asbestos. </p><p>Passages lined with posters tell the story of asbestos in South Africa: the country was once one of the world’s biggest miners of the substance. It was the only country in the world where all three of the main types of asbestos were mined. The mines started to close in the 1990s, the last one shut its doors in 2002, but they’ve left a toxic legacy in parts of the Northern Cape and Mpumalanga</p><p>In a large glass-fronted cabinet lungs damaged  by tiny asbestos fibres are on display. And on a white plinth are samples of the culprits, the three types of asbestos ores – amosite (brown), crocidolite (blue) and chrysotile (white) – each safely encased in thick glass. They are weirdly hairy, and one looks more like a frayed bit of rhino horn than a mineral. </p><p>There Also encased in glass are also samples of the fibre that the ore is processed into. They look innocuous, like lumpy strands of wool. You can see how missionary John Campbell, an English missionary on awho visited to the “asbestos mountains” in Griqualandbetween Kuruman and Prieska in the early 1800s, thought it would be a good idea to weave these fibres into ladies’ dresses in England; “… “many lives would annually be saved, that are lost by their dress catching fire”, he wrote. That was one of the reasons why asbestos was once so popular: its “magical” resistance to fire. </p><p>Those magical properties came at a cost: the high rate of lung disease among workers exposed to asbestos was already being noted by doctors in the early 1900s. But it was only in 1960, that a pathologist at the NIOH, Dr Christopher Wagner, was credited with making the definitive link between asbestos exposure and cancer. (see mesothelioma sidebar)</p><p>In the early 1970s countries started to restrict the use of asbestos. Iceland was the first country to ban the use of all types of asbestos in 1983. Now more than 50 countries, including South Africa have banned asbestos. (see map)</p><p>But asbestos is still all around us. From the late 1800s until the mid-1980s, it was a popular building material thanks to its strength, insulating and fire protection properties and its relatively low manufacturing cost. </p><p>More than 3 000 products contained asbestos. It was mixed with cement to make building materials, such as roof sheeting, partition boards, ceiling boards, pipes and acoustic ceiling tiles. It was in vinyl-asbestos floor tiles, and friable asbestos was used as an insulation material.</p><p>Asbestos cement products were used almost routinely in the building of low-cost, mass housing in South Africa until the mid-1980s, according to a National Economic Development and Labour Council research paper. From the early 1950s, the standard house built in Soweto had a corrugated asbestos roof and many still have them more than 50 years later. “As many as 80% of state buildings contain asbestos materials and products – including insulation materials used for insulating and hot water piping,” stated the report.</p><p>“There’s very little evidence that buildings made with material containing asbestos are dangerous to your health,” said </p><p>From the other side of a large table, Dr David Rees,  the head of occupational medicine and epidemiology at the NIOH told me: “There’s very little evidence that buildings made with material containing asbestos are dangerous to your health.” He’s the head of occupational medicine and epidemiology at the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) and professor of occupational health at the University of the Witwatersrand School of Public Health. </p><p>In research published in 2007, he and colleagues from the NIOH found no significant exposure to asbestos among people living in those houses in Soweto.</p><p>I’m starting to wonder now why the Department of Basic Education made eradicting entirely asbestos schools one of its top priorities, along with making sure all schools have water, electricity and functioning toilets, in the regulations governing norms and standards for school infrastructure.  </p><p>But then Rees added: “The problem comes when the asbestos-containing structures are in disrepair,.” said Dr Rees.</p><p>If a building’s roof is made of asbestos cement sheets, for example, there is no immediate risk to the people in that building. It becomes a health risk if the sheets are damaged so the asbestos fibres are exposed and able to disperse into the air. </p><p>It’ is when tiny asbestos fibres are released from the structures that contain them so they can be inhaled into the lungs that they can cause serious respiratory diseases, such as lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma (see sidebar). </p><p>Asbestos was banned in South Africa in 2008 because of the risk to human health. But asbestos is still all around us. From the late 1800s until the mid-1980s asbestos was a popular building material because of its strength, insulating and fire protection properties as well as its relatively low manufacturing cost. </p><p>More than 3 000 products contained asbestos. It was often mixed with cement to make a range of building materials, such as roof sheeting, roof tiles, ceiling boards, acoustic ceiling tiles, partitioning boards and vinyl-asbestos floor tiles. Friable asbestos was also used as an insulation material.</p><p>In South Africa asbestos cement products were used almost routinely in the building of low-cost, mass housing up until the mid-1980s, according to a National Economic Development and Labour Council research paper. “As many as 80% of state buildings contain asbestos materials and products – including insulation materials used for insulating and hot water piping,” stated the report. </p><p>If a building’s roof is made of asbestos cement sheets, for example, there is no immediate risk to the people in that building. It becomes a health risk if the sheets are damaged so the asbestos fibres are exposed and able to disperse into the air. </p><p>Friable asbestos, such as the type used as insulation material, is more risky because it is much easier to reduce it to a powder.</p><p>It’s usually during renovations when people work on material that contains asbestos with power tools that dust containing asbestos fibres is released into the air, said Dr Jim Phillips, a specialist in the pathology unit of the NIOH.</p><p>If material that contains asbestos is drilled into, cut, cleaned using high-pressure water hoses or demolished, the fabric is disturbed and tiny fibres can be released, he said.</p><p>“Any person that, knowingly or unknowingly, performs work on asbestos or asbestos containing material, and any person that happens to be in the vicinity of such work, is in danger,” states an NIOH pamphlet entitled Asbestos: The Silent Killer.</p><p>Even natural deterioration and weathering can loosen asbestos fibres, the pamphlet states. So it is important to maintain structures that contain asbestos materials in good condition, by coating them with paint or sealant and removing damaged material.</p><p></p><p>According to the Gauteng Department of Education (GDE), the asbestos schools it has identified for replacement were all built before the 1980s. That makes them all over 40 years old, and there is evidence that some of them are not in a good state of repair.</p><p>One school in particular, Noordgesig Primary School in Soweto is an example. It , has received a great deal of media attention over the past year because of the dilapidated condition of some of its 40 asbestos classrooms. </p><p>It has been scheduled for renovations since 2010, according to Equal Education, a non-governmental organisation that has been campaigning to improve the state of South Africa’s schools since 2008. </p><p>Yet seven years later, the school’s 1,500 pupils and 39 teachers are still waiting for the asbestos to be removed and replaced by brick and mortar buildings. </p><p>The school is in on the GDE’s entirely asbestos replacement list, so it should have been rebuilt by November 2016, according to the school infrastructure regulations. But the new school is still at the design stage, four months after the deadline.</p><p>There are currently 29 schools made entirely of asbestos on that list.  </p><p>But there are another 215 schools that aren’t on the replacement list because they are only partially made of asbestos. These schools may be built with bricks and mortar, but have asbestos roofs, said Oupa Bodibe, the GDE’s spokesperson.</p><p>“Some schools are a combination of fibre cement panels with asbestos roofs, to the naked eye the two look exactly the same and it requires technical expertise to provide final confirmation,” he said. </p><p></p><p>Asbestos regulations</p><p>Regulations that apply to buildings that contain asbestos were put in place by the Department of Labour as part of the Occuptional Health and Safety Act in 2001.  As an employer of thousands of teachers and other education staff, the department of education has to follow these Asbestos Regulations. </p><p>Gabriel Mizan, an occuptional hygiene scientist at the NIOH, with an interest in asbestos in schools, summarised what the department of education has a duty as an employer to do under the asbestos regulations. It must: i</p><p>Identify the asbestos in the school buildings; c</p><p>Determine its location</p><p>Compile a written inventory; i</p><p>Inform health and safety representatives; i</p><p>Inform any person who will be doing work at the school; r</p><p>Regularly assess the condition of the asbestos containing structures; and m</p><p>Maintain the asbestos in a good state of repair or remove it if necessary.</p><p>The GDE has not compiled inventories or maintenance plans for any of the 244 schools it has listed as entirely or partially made of asbestos, said Bodibe.</p><p>“The department does not have the required capacity to compile the required inventory. However, we are in the process of acquiring additional capacity to deal with issues of this nature,” he said.</p><p>In a research report published in 2013, Dr Phillips and other researchers at the NIOH described how they had analysed 45 samples taken from South African school buildings between 2003 and 2012 and found asbestos fibres in nearly three-quarters of those samples, it also found asbestos in three of five air filters submitted from education buildings.</p><p>“Those schools found to have buildings that contain asbestos should have warning notices placed in prominent places in the event of any refurbishment, reconstruction or demolition that might otherwise be undertaken without this knowledge and without adhering to the asbestos regulations,” the researchers recommended in their report.</p><p>Khume Ramulifho, the Democratic Alliances’s “shadow education MEC” in Gauteng, who has visited many of the schools on the GDE’s asbestos lists, said he is not aware of the presence of asbestos inventories, nor has he not seen signs on any school buildings warning that they contain asbestos.</p><p>Equal Education conducted an audit of more than 180 schools in Gauteng in 2015. Asked whether it knew if the GDE had ever carried out risk assessments at the province’s public schools in terms of the Asbestos Regulations and whether its members had seen signs at the schools warning people not to carry out renovations on asbestos containing structures, a spokesperson replied: “No, they [the GDE] did not conduct such an assessment. If they did they would have not missed the deadline [29 November 2016, which was when all entirely asbestos schools were supposed to have been replaced].” </p><p>The UK’s department of health looked into the potential harm caused to children by asbestos exposure. Although its report stated that there was no “conclusive evidence of the relative risks of asbestos exposure in a school setting”, it concluded that “due to their longer life expectancy and the long latency period for the disease to develop, children have an increased life-time risk of developing mesothelioma compared to adults if exposed to given doses of asbestos”. </p><p>Mesothelioma takes about 30 years to develop after exposure to asbestos fibres, according to the World Health Organisation.</p><p>Asbestos regulations in the United Kingdom are similar to those in South Africa in that: they require  a “duty holder” to create a register of asbestos-containing materials present in a building and write a management plan that details how the condition of those materials will be monitored. </p><p>The UK’s Department for Education states reviewed its policy on the management of asbestos in schools in 2015 and in a report stated: “The employer should also provide adequate information, instruction and training for any members of school staff, including teachers, likely to disturb asbestos and ensure all school staff, and contractors are aware of the location of asbestos in the building,” </p><p>The UK department said it would carry out air sampling in schools to better understand the levels of asbestos children could be exposed to, and to develop better and more targeted guidance on asbestos management in schools. </p><p>Schools in the United States also have to develop and maintain asbestos management plans, according to regulations set by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>The GDE was asked whether it had a policy in place to deal with the maintenance of schools that are partially asbestos. “The department is planning to replace all asbestos classrooms over time,” replied Bodibe. </p><p>There does not appear to be an official policy on asbestos maintenance along the lines of the US and UK, but, the GDE “continuously does condition assessments to determine all infrastructure intervention required at schools constructed from inappropriate material”, Bodibe added.</p><p>Dr David Rees and Gabriel Mizan of the NIOH think it’s important that South African schools should be assessed for risk and also have asbestos management plans in place. “The schools in Gauteng that are built with material that contains asbestos need to be inspected,” said Mizan. </p><p>“Each school should have recommendations. You could budget money for painting and maintenance, and where there’s damage, remove the asbestos,” said Dr Rees.</p><p>“If I were a parent with a child in school, I’d like to know there’s a proper maintenance programme. And I’d like the school governing body to have some say in the maintenance,” said Dr Rees.</p><p>Equal Education has a rather pessimistic view of the GDE’s approach to asbestos in schools.  “It is important to note that the GDE does not consider this [asbestos] a health hazard, which is strange and unacceptable,” said its spokesperson.</p><p>Sidebar/Illustration 1: Asbestos-related disease in South Africa</p><p>Most people will probably have been exposed to low levels of asbestos fibres during the course of their lives, but it’s generally people who are regularly exposed because of their work or from “substantial environmental exposure” who get sick. </p><p>People who are exposed to asbestos fibres can develop asbestos-related diseases, such as asbestosis, an inflammatory condition of the lungs; lung cancers, such as mesothelioma, a  form of cancer that affects the tissues that line the lungs, chest and abdomen; asbestosis, an inflammatory condition of the lungs; and other forms of lung disease. </p><p>Mesothelioma takes around 30 years to develop after a person has been exposed to asbestos, according to the World Health Organisation.</p><p>South Africa reportedly has one of the highest incidence rates of mesothelioma in the world, thanks to its long history of asbestos mining. Between 2000 and 2012, an average of 166 new cases of mesothelioma were reported a year, according numbers published by South Africa’s National Cancer Registry. </p><p>Researchers think the disease may be underreported. A 2011 study found that South Africa’s mesothelioma mortality rates between 1995 and 2007 were much lower than expected and it was thought that this could be because of under-reporting or the Aids epidemic in the country at the time.</p><p>In a World Health Organisation study South Africa was ranked ninth in the world for highest number of mesothelioma deaths. </p><p> </p><p>In comparison, in the United States nearly 3,000 people a year are diagnosed with mesothelioma and in the UK around 2,000 new cases are registered a year. The US and the UK also have the highest number of deaths from this disease, according to the WHO study. </p><p></p><p>The average age of death from mesothelioma was 70 years old, the WHO found, whereas in South Africa it was a relatively young 63.4 years old, which is relatively young in comparison to other countries where people tended to die in their 70s. The disease is much more common in men than women. </p><p>Mesothelioma can take from 20 to 50 years to develop after a person has been exposed to asbestos fibres. </p><p>Most cases of mesothelioma have a clear history of asbestos exposure, said Dr David Rees, head of occupational medicine and epidemiology at the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) and professor of occupational health at the University of the Witwatersrand School of Public Health.  “But 5 to 10% of cases won’t know where the asbestos they were exposed to came from,” said.</p><p>People who work in the asbestos mining industry, in the building and construction industry, demolishers, motor mechanics and power station workers are often exposed to asbestos in their jobs. </p><p>But people who have never worked in the asbestos industry can be exposed: either because they lived in an asbestos area, or because their parents or another family member worked with asbestos and brought the fibres home on their clothes. </p><p>If a building containing asbestos is demolished without the correct precautions being followed, people in the vicinity can be exposed. For example, when New York’s World Trade Center was attacked in 2011, tons of asbestos were released into the atmosphere.</p><p>Even people who unknowingly carry out repairs on asbestos-containing materials in their homes or other buildings may be exposed to asbestos-containing dust along with anybody else in the vicinity.</p><p>Nearly 30 percent of mesothelioma cases in South Africa are a result of these kinds of environmental exposure to asbestos. </p><p>There are no recorded cases of mesothelioma in teachers as a result of exposure to asbestos in schools in South Africa, but there is also no information about the source of exposure to asbestos in the National Cancer Registry. </p><p>There have been cases of teachers developing mesothelioma in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States.  In the UK, for example, there were 224 mesothelioma deaths recorded between 2003 and 2012 among “teaching professionals”. Although the UK’s department for education noted that it’s difficult to directly link a death from an asbestos-related disease and exposure in a specific occupation because the disease takes such a long time to develop.  There have been a few compensation cases where British courts have ruled that people may have contracted mesothelioma after being exposed to asbestos fibres at school.</p><p>Most cases of mesothelioma have a clear history of asbestos exposure, said Dr David Rees, head of occupational medicine and epidemiology at the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) and professor of occupational health at the University of the Witwatersrand School of Public Health.  “But 5 to 10% of cases won’t know where the asbestos they were exposed to came from,” said.</p><p>People who work in the asbestos mining industry, in the building and construction industry, demolishers, motor mechanics and power station workers may be exposed to asbestos in their jobs. But people who have never worked in the asbestos industry can be exposed: either because they lived in an asbestos area, or because their parents worked with asbestos and brought the fibres home on their clothes. Even people who unknowingly carry out repairs on asbestos-containing materials in their homes or other buildings may be exposed to asbestos-containing dust along with anybody else in the vicinity.</p><p>In a World Health Organisation study South Africa was ranked ninth in the world for highest number of mesothelioma deaths. </p><p>Between 2000 and 2012, an average of 166 new cases of mesothelioma were reported a year, according numbers published by South Africa’s National Cancer Registry. The disease is much more common in men than women The number of other asbestos-related diseases in South Africa is unknown.</p><p>In comparison, in the United States nearly 3,000 people a year are diagnosed with mesothelioma and in the UK around 2,000 new cases are registered a year. The US and the UK also have the highest number of deaths from this disease, according to the WHO study. </p><p>The average age of death from mesothelioma in South Africa was 63.4 years old, which is relatively young in comparison to other countries where people tended to die in their 70s.</p><p>The long latency period may mean that many people in South Africa who have been exposed to asbestos may die from something else, such as an HIV-related illness or TB, before mesothelioma has time to take hold, so the mesothelioma numbers may be underestimated.</p><p></p><p></p><p>
