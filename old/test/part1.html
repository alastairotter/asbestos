      <p>Asbestos was banned in South Africa 2008, all schools built of it were supposed to have been replaced by November 2016, but only one of Gauteng’s 29 asbestos schools has been replaced so far, and hundreds more schools appear to be falling through the cracks.</p><p>By Laura Grant</p><p>Part 1: Clustered in the south and the townships</p><p>The old blue buildings at Everest Primary School in Newclare will soon be gone, they’re being demolished – carefully – because they contain asbestos, a material that was banned in South Africa in 2008 because it’s known to cause cancer.</p><p>From Hamilton Street, you can see Everest’s new yellow-brick school building taking shape. At the bottom end of the property, on the Wanderers Avenue side, some of the school’s 900 children play outside white mobile classrooms. It won’t be long before they’ll get to move into their smart new building. </p><p>Everest Primary is one of 29 schools in Gauteng earmarked for replacement by the province’s department of education because they contain asbestos. They all should have been replaced by 29 November 2016, but none of them were. Everest is the only one where construction has even started.</p><p>The deadline was set in November 2013 when Minister of Education Angie Motshekga signed legislation stipulating the minimum infrastructure standards that all South Africa’s public schools must meet. The regulations stated that schools made of mud, wood, metal and asbestos had to be replaced with appropriate building materials within three years. </p><p>No mud, wood or metal schools were identified in Gauteng, just the asbestos schools. The Gauteng Education Department (GDE) is way behind schedule.</p><p>Everest Primary is not the only asbestos school in the suburb. Newclare Primary School, a couple of blocks away on Polack Street, is on the GDE’s replacement list too. But Newclare Primary is unlikely to be replaced until at least 2019.</p><p>Newclare lies just west of Joburg’s CBD. More than half of the people who live there are coloured, according to Statistics South Africa’s Census 2011 racial classifications. It’s close to Sophiatown – or Triomf as it used to be known, after the apartheid government in the 1950s forcibly removed the people who lived there. It’s also next door to Westbury, an area with a reputation for drugs and gang violence. </p><p>Not far away, on the other side of Main Reef Road, is Riverlea, where another three of Gauteng’s 29 asbestos schools are located: Wilhelmina Hoskins Primary, Riverlea Primary and Riverlea Secondary School.</p><p>In fact, nearly two-thirds of the asbestos schools identified by the GDE are clustered in south-western Johannesburg, in an area that extends for roughly 15km from Newclare and Riverlea, down through Noordegsig, Orlando East and Pimville in Soweto, to Eldorado Park. </p><p>Six asbestos schools are scattered around Tshwane, one is in Ekurhuleni, two are in Randfontein, one is in Vereeniging, and two are in northern Johannesburg.</p><p>Altogether, more than 25,000 learners and nearly 700 teachers attend these 29 schools.</p><p>A much bigger problem</p><p>But the 29 schools on the GDE’s replacement list are only a small part of the province’s asbestos story.</p><p>For some reason, the school infrastructure regulations distinguish between schools that are built “entirely of asbestos” and those that are built “partially of asbestos”. This means that schools that have some asbestos buildings, such as Noordgesig Secondary School in Soweto, which has 24 asbestos classrooms, but one brick-and-mortar building,  are not deemed to be entirely asbestos and therefore don’t have to be replaced within the three-year timeframe. </p><p>Clearly deciding which schools are entirely asbestos schools isn’t a straightforward process. The GDE’s list has changed a few times in the year and half since it was first made public. The current list of 29 was first made public in October 2016.</p><p>“Initially, 21 schools built entirely of asbestos were identified in the province. But the brief was later expanded to include schools built predominantly of asbestos,” explained Oupa Bodibe, the GDE’s spokesperson. </p><p>“These are schools that were initially built entirely of asbestos, but when additional facilities were built, such as additional classrooms or toilets, these structures were built of brick and mortar,” he said.</p><p>The important distinction in terms of the regulations is that by law “entirely asbestos” schools had to be replaced within three years of the regulations being passed, but there is no deadline for the replacement of partially asbestos schools.</p><p>This distinction between entirely and partially asbestos schools and the prioritisation of only entirely asbestos schools does not make sense to Equal Education, a non-governmental organisation that has been campaigning for years for legally binding norms and standards for school infrastructure. </p><p>“There is no rational basis for excluding an unsafe school or classroom from the ambit of the regulation, merely because part of the school is safe,” its spokesperson said.</p><p>So the 29 Gauteng schools listed for replacement are merely those considered to be entirely or predominantly asbestos. </p><p>“The province does have other schools that don’t fall into the three-year timeline, although they are partially built with asbestos,” said Bodibe.</p><p>There are, in fact, 214 of them, according to a list compiled by the GDE in 2014. </p><p>Most of those partially asbestos schools are clustered in townships, such as Soweto, Tembisa, Thokoza, Kathlehong, Vosloorus, Mamelodi and Hammanskraal (see map). </p><p>What this means is that – assuming the GDE’s asbestos schools lists are accurate and complete – 243 of the public schools in Gauteng contain asbestos. That’s just over one in 10 of the province’s 2,000 schools. </p><p>This affects over 300,000 learners, two thirds of whom are primary school children, and nearly 10,000 teachers, not to mention non-teaching staff, according to numbers published on the DBE’s 2016 school masterlist.</p><p>“Asbestos fibres are so dangerous that it is illegal for an employer to put any person at risk of exposure to them – and yet teachers and children are in school buildings made of the substance,”</p><p>said a spokespserson for Equal Education.</p><p>Yet neither the GDE nor the national Department of Basic Education (DBE) appear to be overtly concerned about the November 2016 deadline for the replacement of the entirely asbestos buildings being missed.</p><p>The DBE’s spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, did not reply when asked twice via email whether the minister of education intended to do anything about the GDE missing the deadline to remove the province’s 29 asbestos schools and whether they are safe for teaching purposes. However, he did respond that he had referred my questions to the appropriate person at the GDE, but the GDE did not reply. </p><p>Equal Education is demanding that all schools built with asbestos containing materials, not just the 29 entirely asbestos schools, are “eradicated” and fixed by 29 November 2020.</p><p>According to Equal Education, the GDE has undertaken to have the 29 asbestos schools fixed by 2020. The NGO said Panyaza Lesufi, Gauteng’s education MEC, made a commitment to do this at a meeting in March. </p><p>A GDE report on asbestos schools published recently on its website appears to back this up. The report states that five schools are currently in commission and that the department “envisages rebuilding” 12 more schools by 2019, and that it “has made an application to the national department of basic education for Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (Asidi) funding with the intention to fast track and replace the remaining 12 asbestos schools within the next two financial years.”</p><p>The report mentions nothing about the 214 partially asbestos schools. </p><p>“The department is planning to replace all asbestos classrooms over time,” said Bodibe, the GDE’s spokesperson. </p><p>Budget had been allocated to fix only 13 of the 214 partially asbestos schools before 2030 in the Gauteng’s school infrastructure project list, which was published in 2015, and is the only project list the province has made publicly available. </p><p>By that time, this year’s grade ones would have finished matric, and Noordgesig Secondary’s teachers and learners would have had to wait 13 years for their dilapidated asbestos classrooms to be replaced. </p><p>Noordgesig Secondary features in the founding affidavit filed by Equal Education in a case it is bringing against the minister of education and the provincial education MECs to “fix” the norms and standards regulations. </p><p>“The asbestos classrooms have been in existence for around 70 years, since the school opened. Some of the asbestos classrooms have started to crumble and break, exposing the asbestos,” said  Isaac Ramrock, the chairperson of the school governing body in the affidavit.</p><p>If the law is allowed to stand as it is, Noordgesig Secondary and the other 200-plus partially asbestos schools will have no claim on government as far as the inappropriate structures deadline is concerned, hence the #FixTheNorms court case, said a spokesperson for Equal Education. </p><p>“The replacement of asbestos schools and classrooms are budget related – meaning it depends on the availability of funds,” said Bodibe.</p><p> “It must be noted,” he added, “that the department’s infrastructure budget is revised on an annual basis; this includes the revision of the infrastructure project list.</p><p>“The latest revision is currently under way and the outcome of this process will determine by when the individual asbestos classrooms at existing schools will be replaced.”</p><p>But even if the law is changed to include all 243 schools and the project list is revised, given the GDE’s track record at missing deadlines, it may be many years before even the 29 schools on the entirely asbestos list are replaced.</p><p>
